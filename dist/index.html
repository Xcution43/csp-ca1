    In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate an energy called Cursed Energy,<sup>[Jp. 1]</sup> which arises from negative emotions
    that naturally flow throughout the body. Normal people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they
    continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses,<sup>[Jp. 2]</sup> a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire
    is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters.
    
    Jujutsu Sorcerers<sup>[Jp. 3]</sup> are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as
    they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to
    perform Cursed Techniques,<sup>[Jp. 4]</sup> which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed
    Technique is Domain Expansion,<sup>[Jp. 5]</sup> through which the user can use their Cursed Energy to build a pocket dimension
    that covers the surrounding area within which all attacks will be stronger. </p>

            <p id="3" style="color: white;">
                Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instills two
                powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's friends at the Occult Club
                attract Curses to their school when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which Yuji swallowed to protect Megumi
                Fushiguro and their friends, becoming host to a powerful curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all
                sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and by extension, Yuji) immediately. But upon seeing Yuji retaining control over
                his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his
                superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse
                can be completely destroyed. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of
                jujutsu sorcery, including the cursed spirit Mahito, whose "Idle Transfiguration" can reshape the soul of any human, and
                a disgruntled sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was assumed to have died a year ago. At the exchange event between the
                Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu schools, some want Yuji dead immediately, while others side with Gojo to keep him alive. Gojo
                and Geto failed to protect a young girl from Toji Fushiguro, Megumi's father, an assassin from the Zenin clan. Geto
                decides the world must be cleansed of non-sorcerers so no more cursed spirits can manifest.
                
                The disfigured Kyoto Jujutsu Tech second-year student Kokichi Muta is revealed to be a mole. Geto and the cursed spirits
                lay a screen over Shibuya. Various sorcerers arrive at the scene to fight them. Gojo fights off cursed spirits and
                destroys Hanami, but sealed away in Prison Realm. The event also confirms that Geto is death his corpse possessed by an
                ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku. Yuji and their allies face Kenjaku's forces with both sides suffering losses, Gojo still
                trapped. As the incident ends, Kenjaku reveals that he has been jumping from body to body for thousands of years and
                implanted Binding Vows, which in turn awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan including Tsumiki. He then
                releases many curses onto Japan, the first step into creating chaos and a world of cursed spirits like the Heian period.
                
                In the aftermath, Yuji and Megumi team up with second-year Yuta Okkotsu and Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade jujutsu
                sorcerer and one of the most powerful sorcerers of all time along with Choso and second-year student Maki Zenin to meet
                with Tengen. Tengen, an immortal, part-curse part-human jujutsu sorcerer, reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge Tengen's
                consciousness with Japan's human population. The Culling Game, Kenjaku's all-out war between the sorcerers and curse
                users of Japan, then begins. </p>

                In 2017, Gege Akutami published Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, a 4-chapter series that ran in Jump GIGA from
                April 28 to July 28.<sup>[3][4]</sup> This series would serve later as a prequel to Jujutsu Kaisen, being retroactively titled as
                Jujutsu Kaisen 0.<sup>[5]</sup> Jujutsu Kaisen debuted in Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 5, 2018.<sup>[6]</sup>
                
                Akutami stated that Neon Genesis Evangelion influenced the mythological aspects of the series,<sup>[7]</sup> being also influenced
                by horror and found footage films.<sup>[8]</sup> Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of YuYu Hakusho and
                Hunter × Hunter,<sup>[8][9]</sup> expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.<sup>[7]</sup> The author is also a
                fan of Tite Kubo, author of Bleach, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.<sup>[10][11]</sup>
                Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto) and Yusuke Murata (Eyeshield 21 and
                One-Punch Man illustrator).<sup>[7]</sup> The magic system of Jujutsu Kaisen is largely based on Hunter × Hunter, whose fights, in
                Akutami's words, "rejects emotional arguments", stating, however, that like Daisuke Ashihara, World Trigger's author,
                whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami is trying to find and develop an own style.<sup>[8]</sup>
                
                In October 2020, Akutami stated that the ending and the main stages of the story are planned, but the path between the
                two remains "fairly free".<sup>[7]</sup> In February 2021, Akutami stated that the series would probably be finished within two
                years, declaring however no confidence in that statement. Akutami knows how the story for Megumi Fushiguro will end, but
                not for Sukuna.<sup>[12]</sup> On June 9, 2021, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus due to the author's health
                issues,<sup>[13][14]</sup> and the manga resumed publication on August 2 of the same year.<sup>[15][16]</sup> </p>

                Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave the first volume a score of 8.5 /10. Douresseaux praised the series for its
                characters, plots, settings, and internal mythology, and described it as a "combination battle manga and horror comic
                book".<sup>[100]</sup> Shawn Hacaga of The Fandom Post, in his review of the first volume, compared the series to early Bleach and
                praised it for its world, lore, characters and artwork, concluding that it is a "solid first volume".<sup>[101]</sup> Hannah
                Collins of CBR found parallels between Yuji and Sukuna and Marvel Comics characters Eddie Brock and Venom. She also
                noted similarities to Bleach, Blue Exorcist and Tokyo Ghoul. Collins commended the manga and regarding its then recently
                announced anime adaptation concluded that Jujutsu Kaisen is a "darkly enjoyable action series that's sure to be one to
                watch out for in 2020".<sup>[102]</sup> Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network ranked the first volume as a C. Silverman praised
                the series' use of Japanese folklore and yōkai elements, comparing this and Akutami's art style to Shigeru Mizuki's
                GeGeGe no Kitarō, but criticized the story for being "very generic". She concluded; "It has the potential to be more as
                Akutami gets more comfortable with the serialization process and figures out precisely where the story is going, so it
                may be worth a second book to be certain. But as of this one, it's just okay, making it the kind of series that gets
                damned with faint praise".<sup>[103]</sup> Azusa Takahashi of Real Sound praised its storytelling, setting and "surprising" story
                development, also noting similarities to other works like Bleach, Ushio & Tora or Neon Genesis Evangelion, stating,
                however, that the series is not only a homage to popular works centered on the battle development, but that it has a
                "clever composition that sublimates into originality, so you have to be absorbed in it."<sup>[104]</sup></p>

                won the "Best Antagonist" category and "Lost in Paradise feat. AKLO" by ALI won the "Best Ending Sequence"
                category.<sup>[105][106]</sup> In January 2021, it was revealed that the anime series was the second most-watched anime series on

                America, South and Central America, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Africa, Asia and Oceania.<sup>[107]</sup> The official

                being one of the fastest anime openings to hit such number of views.<sup>[108]</sup> In 2021, Jujutsu Kaisen was 2nd the anime

                Micah Peters of The Ringer said that while the series' "focused execution" of shōnen tropes makes it "infinitely
                watchable", is its "specificity, its personality, its ultra-slick stylishness" what make the show special. He added:
                "Like with Park’s previous work, there is a sumptuous amount of splashy, expensive, mo-cap-enabled animation, delivering
                on the action promised by the comics".<sup>[111]</sup> Paul Thomas Chapman of Otaku USA called it a "prime example of average
                material elevated by excellent execution", adding that it is similar to Bleach and YuYu Hakusho. Chapman commented that
                Sunghoo Park "puts the “beatdown” in narrative beats", being able to "segue from goofy comedy to chilling horror in an
                instant", and that he and the crew at MAPPA "make this narrative mutability seem effortless".<sup>[112]</sup> Ana Diaz of Polygon
                highlighted the 17th episode, praising the series' treatment of its female characters, different to other shōnen series.
                Diaz wrote: "Jujutsu Kaisen goes a step further than avoiding gender tropes by presenting a variety of female
                perspectives. It’s not like there’s any right way for these young women to deal with the unique pressures they face. The
                story lets them disagree, and fight for their perspectives and their place". She concluded: "The show’s widespread
                success signals that audiences aren’t just ready for change, they’re actively craving it. Now, every other creator has
                the green light to write all kinds of women into their shows".<sup>[113]</sup></p>
